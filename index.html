    <p>
        My name is Heidi Jiang. I'm a second-year student at Northeastern University,
        and my major is Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration
        in Finance. My hometown is Foster City, California. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I participated in the N.U.in program during my first semester at Northeastern, 
        so I got the opportunity to study abroad in Thessaloniki, Greece. I enjoyed 
        exploring the culture, food, and architecture in Greece. I also met many of my 
        closest friends through the N.U.in program.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been exploring my interests in machine learning, neural networks, and 
        web development. Some of my non-CS-related hobbies include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, 
        cooking, philosophy, astronomy, digital art, and learning languages.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently a teaching assistant for Financial Accounting and Reporting 
        at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business. I grade exams, create homework 
        assignments, and host weekly office hours to answer questions from students. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I've also been interning as an LLM Engineer at Fengyun Vision, LLC. I'm 
        developing an AI sales chatbot for E-commerce companies that will eventually 
        be integrated with Facebook Messenger. This chatbot relies on a RAG pipeline 
        that pulls context from previous conversations between human sales representatives 
        and their customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most recently, my friend offered me a position in app development for a soccer league.
