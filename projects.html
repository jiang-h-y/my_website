        This project was a website designed to make grocery shopping easier
        for Northeastern students by consolidating data about inventory and prices
        from grocery stores near campus. Since this type of data was unavailable online, 
        my team wanted to crowdsource the data from Northeastern students. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To do so, the website included a barcode scanner that had two functions. 
        First, people could point their camera at a food product and retrieve
        nutritional information about the food from the Open Food Facts API. Second,
        once the barcode was scanned, people could opt to add the food into the website's
        database, allowing other students to view information about the food. We would
        incentivize students to participate in this program by offering grocery store
        credits to students who added a certain amount of food products to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        My team also wanted to ensure that the website was accessible for people with food
        allergies or dietary restrictions. By scanning the barcode, people could view all
        the labels associated with a food (e.g. gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, etc).
        Additionally, the website had a smart search algorithm that allowed users to
        search for the types of products they needed. This search algorithm could distinguish
        between whether students were searching for a brand (e.g, "Hood milk") or
        a type of food (e.g. "vegan milk").

        This project was a neural network that determined the optimal use of land for
        brownfield redevelopment. Brownfields are underutilized or abandoned tracts of
        land that are highly contaminated from industrial use. By suggesting a better
        use for the land, this project aimed to reduce environmental damage and revitalize
        the surrounding community.
    </p>
    <p>
        The neural network uses features that consider social and environmental factors,
        as well as the structure of the building currently located on the land. The dataset
        consisted of historical land use data from Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
        My team also started working on integrating a frontend to make the results
        more interpretable for users.
